- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HBRYU on Github, mainly active on reddit.
- I'm a student learning computer programming, mainly game development, as a hobby and hopefully a career someday.
- I don't do colaborations yet, since I learned half my shit from youtube not knowing any of the fundementals. I might do some after graduating from collage.
